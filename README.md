Command grok provides standalone server terminating https and proxying
requests in plain http over reverse ssh tunnels.

The main goal is the same as for ngrok tool from https://ngrok.com:

> I want to expose a local server behind a NAT or firewall to the internet.

See https://godoc.org/github.com/artyom/grok for details.
